# Data Processing Application
This is the capstone project for Microsoft's Intermediate C++ Programming Techniques course. The goal is to create a data processing application that can read data from at least one file format, process the data through various functions, and output the results.

## Project Requirements
1. File input / output operations
	- Read data from at least one file format (CSV, JSON, or plain text)
	- Write processed results to output files

2. Data parsing and processing
	- Parse structured data from input files
	- Validate data for completeness and correctness
	- Apply transformations or analysis to the data

3. Modular program structure
	- Organize code into appropriate functions
	- Use namespaces to manage code organization
	- Apply best practices for code readability and maintenance

4. External library integration
	- Incorporate at least one external library
	- Document the library's purpose and integration

5. Error handling
	- Implement robust error handling for file operations
	- Validate user inputs and provide helpful error messages
	- Ensure the program doesn't crash on invalid data

## Data Processing Tasks Implemented
This application takes a text file and is able to perform the following tasks:

1. Word count
Counts the number of words in the text file and outputs the total into the console.
